    "Each week you will complete a lecture assignment like this one. Before we get started, there are some administrative details.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can't learn technical subjects without hands-on practice. The weekly lecture worksheets and tutorials are an important part of the course. The lecture worksheets and tutorials will automatically be collected on the due date. Attendance in lectures and tutorials are required. There will be participatory activities in both the lecture and tutorial to help support your learning.\n",
    "\n",

    "- The tutorial assignments are worth 15% of your final grade. \n",

    "    - Each manually graded question is worth 3 points. \n",

    "Collaborating on lecture worksheets and tutorial assignments is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely be stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in lecture or tutorial, so ask a neighbor, TA or an instructor for help (explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it). Please don't just share answers, though. Everyone must submit a copy of their own work.\n",

    "* use a Jupyter notebook to execute provided Python code\n",
    "* edit code and markdown cells in a Jupyter notebook\n",
    "* create new code and markdown cells in a Jupyter notebook\n",
    "* load the `pandas` package into Python \n",
    "* create new variables and objects in Python\n",
    "* use the help and documentation tools in Python\n",
    "* perform the following operations from the `pandas` package:\n",
    "    - Read a standard .csv file using `read_csv`.\n",
    "    - subset rows and columns of a data frame using `loc[]`.\n",
    "    - select columns of a dataframe using `[]`.\n",
    "    - create a new column of a dataframe using `assign`.\n",
    "* use `Altair` package to create plots \n",
    "\n",
    "In this first worksheet you will also learn how to test the answers you write in this worksheet to assess if you answered questions correctly before your assignment is collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "This worksheet covers parts of [the Introduction chapter](https://python.datasciencebook.ca/intro.html) of the online textbook. In most worksheets we expect you to read the textbook chapters before completing the worksheet, however we know that might not have been possible for this worksheet, so we have added a bit more help to get you through. You still should however read the chapter to get a deeper understanding of this week's material (it will help you more easily answer the problems in this week's tutorial homework). \n",
    "\n",
    "Any place you see `___`, you must fill in the function, variable, or data to complete the code. Substitute the `None` and the `raise NotImplementedError # No Answer - remove if you provide an answer` with your completed code and answers then proceed to run the cell!"

    "\n",
    "Now that we have learned a little about Jupyter notebooks and Python, let's load a real dataset into Python and explore it. As we do this we will learn more about key data loading, wrangling and visualization functions in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise: Data about Runners!\n",
    "Researchers, Vickers and Vertosick performed [a study in 2016](https://bmcsportsscimedrehabil.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13102-016-0052-y) that aimed to identify what factors had a relationship with race performance of recreational runners so that they could better predict future 5 km, 10 km and marathon race times for individual runners. Such predictions (and knowing what drives these predictions) can help runners by suggesting changes they could make to modifiable factors, such as training, to help them improve race time. Unmodifiable factors that contribute to the prediction, such as age or sex, allow for fair comparisons to be made between different runners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vickers and Vertosick reasoned that their study is important because all previous research done to predict races times has focused on data from elite athletes. This biased data set means that the predictions generated from them do not necessarily do a good job predicting race times for recreational runners (whose data was not in the dataset that was used to create the model that generates the predictions). Additionally, previous research focused on reporting/measuring factors that require special expertise or equipment that are not freely available to recreational runners. This means that recreational runners may not be able to put their characteristics/measurements for these factors in the race time prediction models and so they will not be able to obtain an accurate prediction, or a prediction at all (in the case of some models).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a better model, Vickers and Vertosick performed a large survey. They put their survey on the news website [Slate.com](https://slate.com/) attached to a news story about race time prediction. They were able to obtain 2,497 responses. The survey included questions that allowed them to collect a data set that included: \n",
    "- age,\n",
    "- sex,\n",
    "- body mass index (BMI),\n",
    "- whether they are an edurance runner or speed demon,\n",
    "- what type of shoes they wear,\n",
    "- what type of training they do,\n",
    "- race time for 2-3 races they completed in the last 6 months,\n",
    "- self-rated fitness for each race,\n",
    "- and race difficulty for each race.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now use this data to explore a question we might be interested in - is there a relationship between 10 km race time and body mass index (BMI) for male runners in this data set. This is an exploratory data analysis question because we stated we looking for a relationship between measurements within the single data set we have and are not interested in yet interpreting beyond it. We can answer this question by visualizing the data as a scatter plot using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, however we are not aiming to extend our findings to a broader population, make predictions, analyze cause or mechanics, we would need to state a different data analyis question and follow-up with different analytical methods to answer that question.\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer our exploratory question (is there a relationship between 10 km race time and body mass index (BMI) for men runners in this data set), we will need to do the following things in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. load the data set into Python\n",
    "2. subset the data we are interested in visualizing from the loaded dataset\n",
    "3. create a new column to get the unit of time in minutes instead of seconds\n",
    "4. create a scatter plot using this modified data\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Note 1 - subsetting the data and converting from seconds to minutes is not absolutely required to answer our question, but it will give us practice manipulating data in Python, and make our data tables and figures more readable.*\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *Note 2 - many historical datasets treated sex as a variable where the possible values are only binary: male or female. This representation in this question reflects how the data were historically collected and is not meant to imply that we believe that sex is binary.*"
