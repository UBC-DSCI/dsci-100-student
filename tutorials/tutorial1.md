## Intro to shell and the terminal

Basically followed this [unix shell tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), step 1 to 3, and gave an especial attention to motivation.

Some useful comments for motivation are:

- Why? -> Why use R instead of Excel?
    - Repetitive tasks
        - Rename many files at the same time
    - Remote computer
        - Example: cluster
        - Example: container (docker)
    - Tools
        - Exists CLI but no GUI
            - Example: docker on linux (I guess)
        - It is easier to code a CLI than a GUI
