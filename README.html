<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>Use of data science tools to summarize, visualize, and analyze data.
Sensible workflows and clear interpretations are emphasized.</p>
<p><strong>Long Version:</strong> In recent years, virtually all areas
of inquiry have seen an uptake in the use of data science tools. Skills
in the areas of assembling, analyzing, and interpreting data are more
critical than ever. This course is designed as a first experience in
honing such skills. Students who have completed this course will be able
to implement a data science workflow in the R programming language, by
“scraping” (downloading) data from the internet, “wrangling” (managing)
the data intelligently, and creating tables and/or figures that convey a
justifiable story based on the data. They will be adept at using tools
for finding patterns in data and making predictions about future data.
There will be an emphasis on intelligent and reproducible workflow, and
clear communications of findings. No previous programming skills
necessary; beginners are welcome!</p>

## Dealing With COVID-19

**In-Person Section: please see Canvas for rules we are implementing this semester to limit the spread of COVID-19.**

The [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen) has affected us all in different ways. It's okay to not be okay, and you should never hesitate to reach out to your instructor if you need support. Just ask! UBC also has [great student support resources](https://students.ubc.ca/covid19) related to COVID-19 (and otherwise).

Also, please keep in mind that running a course during a pandemic is a new experience for your teaching team. The way this course usually runs (with a lot of close interaction between students and instructors) is not safe when we are trying to limit the spread of COVID-19. So a lot of how we run things in-class will be a bit "experimental," and we will have to adjust on the fly; please do not hesitate to provide feedback on how we can improve your learning experience.

a laptop from the UBC library</a>.</p>
<p>All other required software will be provided by the instructors.
Students will learn to perform their analysis using the <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R programming language</a>.
Worksheets and tutorial problem sets as well as the final project
analysis, development, and reports will be done using <a
href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a> accessed via <a
href="https://canvas.ubc.ca">Canvas</a>.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisite-knowledge">Prerequisite Knowledge</h2>
<ul>
<li>distance between points on a graph</li>
<li>percentages, average</li>
<li>powers, roots, basic operations, logarithm, exponential</li>

<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>
<h3 id="late-registration">Late Registration</h3>
<p>Students who register for the class late have 1 week from their
registration date on Canvas to complete all prior assignments.</p>
<h3 id="late-assignments-quiz-absence">Late Assignments / Quiz
Absence</h3>
<p>Students <strong>must be present</strong> at the invigilation venue
(in class, examination centre, etc) to take quizzes; otherwise they will
be considered to have missed the quiz and will be assigned a grade of
zero.</p>
<p>Students who will miss a quiz <strong>must provide a self-declaration
of academic concession prior to the quiz</strong> (see Canvas homepage
for the academic concession form) and make arrangements with the
Instructor. Failing to present a declaration within a reasonable
timeframe before the quiz will result in a grade of zero.</p>
<p>There will be <strong>no extensions for the lecture and tutorial
worksheets</strong>; late assignments will receive a grade of zero.
Instead, we will drop the lowest 2 grades on tutorials and worksheets
for the semester. However, if you have extenuating circumstances and
require further accommodations, please contact the course
coordinator.</p>
<p>For all other assignments and the course project, a <strong>late
submission will receive a 50% penalty</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="autograder-policy">Autograder Policy</h3>
<p>Many of the questions in assignments are graded automatically by
software. The grading computer has exactly the same hardware setup as
the server that students work on. No assignment, when completed, should
take longer than 5 minutes to run on the server. The autograder will
automatically stop (time out) for each student assignment after a
maximum of 5 minutes; <strong>any ungraded questions at that point will
receive a score of 0.</strong></p>
<p>Students are responsible for making sure their assignments are
<em>reproducible</em>, and run from beginning to end on the autograding
computer. In particular, <strong>please ensure that any data that needs
to be downloaded is done so by the assignment notebook with the correct
filename to the correct folder.</strong> A common mistake is to manually
download data when working on the assignment, making the autograder
unable to find the data and often resulting in an assignment grade of
0.</p>
<p>In short: whatever grade the autograder returns after 5 minutes
(assuming the teaching team did not make an error) is the grade that
will be assigned.</p>
<h3 id="re-grading">Re-grading</h3>
<p>Students get a free 1% at the end of the course. If you want
questions regraded, you can fill out a form at the end of the term
documenting in detail what you want regraded. Regrading is only offered
if the teaching team makes a mistake. If the total sum of value of
possible points via regrading is greater than 1%, you can submit (please
do so before the last day of class); otherwise the regrade request is
rejected. Note: If you submit a regrade request, you may get less than
1% via regrade.</p>
<p>Note if you received 0 on an assignment when you shouldn’t have,
please contact the course coordinator as soon as possible rather than
waiting until the end of the term.</p>
<h3 id="devicebrowser">Device/Browser</h3>
<p>Students are responsible for using a device and browser compatible
with all functionality of Canvas. Chrome or Firefox browsers are
recommended; Safari has had issues with Canvas quizzes in the past.</p>
<h3 id="missed-final-exam">Missed Final Exam</h3>
<p>Students who miss the final quiz must report to their faculty
advising office within 72 hours of the missed exam, and must supply
supporting documentation. Only your faculty advising office can grant
deferred standing in a course. You must also notify your instructor
prior to (if possible) or immediately after the exam. Your instructor
will let you know when you are expected to write your deferred exam.
Deferred exams will ONLY be provided to students who have applied for
and received deferred standing from their faculty.</p>
<h3 id="academic-concession-policy">Academic Concession Policy</h3>
<p>Please see <a
href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,329,0,0">UBC’s
concession policy</a> for detailed information on dealing with missed
coursework, quizzes, and exams under circumstances of an acute and
unanticipated nature.</p>
<p>See our Canvas homepage for the academic concession form.</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and
integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to
know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic
integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original
work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas
and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should
not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations
of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the
academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh
sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating
may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious
consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s
Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in
order to monitor and prevent recurrences.</p>
<p>A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the
University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the Academic
Calendar at <a
href="http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0"
class="uri">http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0</a>.</p>
<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>
<p>Students must correctly cite any code or text that has been authored
by someone else or by the student themselves for other assignments.
Cases of plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the reproduction (copying and pasting) of code or text with none or
minimal reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables)</li>
<li>the translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to
another</li>
<li>the generation of code and/or text by automatic code-generation
software or large language model</li>
</ul>
<p>An “adequate acknowledgement” requires a detailed identification of
the (parts of the) code or text reused and a full citation of the
original source code that has been reused.</p>
<p>The above attribution policy applies only to assignments. <strong>No
code or text may be copied (with or without attribution) from any source
during a quiz or exam. Answers must always be in your own words. At a
minimum, copying will result in a grade of 0 for the related
question.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Repeated plagiarism of any form could result in larger
penalties, including failure of the course.</strong></p>
