# What if my travel to Vancouver is delayed?

**If you will be late by a few weeks:** don't panic! There will be
recordings of one section of the lectures on the Canvas page, and all of your coursework will
be completed on our course server electronically, so you won't miss anything.

**If you will be absent beyond the add/drop date, please do not take an in-person section of this course.**
Unless the current restrictions are extended beyond Jan 24, you are required to be present in Vancouver for this course. We hold our quizzes in-person, and attendance is mandatory. If you have concerns,\ contact science advising and talk to them about your options.

# What if I get sick during the semester?

### DO NOT COME TO CLASS.

Video recording of lectures videos will continue to be posted to Canvas, so you will not miss anything.

You can complete all of your assignments electronically (and remotely).

I will drop the lowest worksheet and tutorial grade from the semester.

# What if I get sick right before a quiz?

### DO NOT COME TO THE QUIZ.

Your instructor or the coordinator will make alternate arrangements if you get sick right before/during a quiz. Please contact your instructor as far in advance as possible, and fill out an academic
concession form (available on the Canvas page).

# What is the structure of the class?

Each week will have the following pattern:

- Your instructor will release pre-lecture reading material on Monday
- In class, your instructor will begin with a brief lecture to introduce a new
  concept. Then you'll do a worksheet to practice the concept.
- Your lecture worksheet will be due **Saturday at 11:59pm pacific time**.
- In tutorial, the TAs will run a tutorial to reinforce the concept we learned
  in lecture. You'll do another worksheet to practice the concept. The
tutorial worksheets are generally harder than the lecture worksheets.
- The tutorial worksheet will be due **Saturday at 11:59 pacific time**.

There will be 3 quizzes throughout the semester; the first two are held in
class, and the last is during the exam period, but they'll all be the same
format (unless otherwise notified).

There will be a class project, which you will complete with a randomly-assigned
group.

# How do I submit an assignment?

**Lecture / Tutorial Worksheets:** You must complete all of your lecture and
tutorial worksheets on our JupyterHub server. Once you are done working, just
go to File -> Save and Checkpoint, and make sure the checkpoint is "a few
seconds ago" at the top of your screen. We will show you how to do this in
class. You don't need to click "submit" anywhere -- our server will
automatically take a snapshot of your assignment at the due date. Make sure you
do not move / rename your assignment from where it originally was on the
server.

**Projects / other assignments:** You will submit these on Canvas.

# How do I get my assignment regraded?

*Please see the course syllabus:* 

*Note:* We will only regrade to correct mistakes that we made when grading.
Please see the syllabus for our policy regarding autograding.

# Where do I find due dates?

All due dates are listed on Canvas.

# What if I registered late? When are things due?

Hi! Welcome to DSCI100 -- glad to have you on board. Since we have a new
assignment in every class session, there are already a few assignments to catch
up on:

If you registered after a class session already
happened, then the assignment from that class session will be due exactly 1
week after your registration date & time.


If you registered before a class session happens, the
assignment from that class is due at the normal time.

# I'm going to be late / absent for a class! Who do I notify?

Your instructor does not need to be informed when you'll be absent from a regular class. 
We understand that, from time to time, you will not be able to 
attend the lecture/tutorial sessions. There are no marks assigned 
for attending class. We hope that the
flexibility of this course will allow you to access the learning materials
wherever you are and whenever you need them. 

If you are going to be absent from a quiz, you need to fill out a self-declared
concession form in a timely manner prior to the quiz. See the course policies
on the syllabus for details.

# Do I satisfy the math requirement for this class?

Yes. There is no hard math prerequisite; MATH12 (or equivalent) is suggested but not required.

# How do I get help in the course?
**During Lectures & Tutorials:** You can use lecture and tutorial time to ask
questions, discuss and receive individual feedback regarding your worksheets,
tutorials, or group project. Myself, the TAs and your fellow classmates will be
available to help you work through the problems.

**Office Hours:** The TAs and I will hold office hours at various times
throughout the week via Zoom/in-person. See the course syllabus for times/locations. I encourage you to ask
questions about the worksheets, tutorials, the project or any other questions
about the course material.

**Piazza Discussion Board:** You can post on the Piazza Discussion board to ask
your questions about the course material. You can also help your classmates by
answering their questions.

**Email:** **For questions about the course material, please post your questions on Piazza.**
If you have personal questions that do not pertain to the course
material itself you can email the course coordinator (please see syllabus for emails). Please note: Most instructors only respond to emails Monday to Friday, and try their best to answer you as promptly as possible. However, given the large class size it may take a few days to respond.

**Please send emails it to the email address listed on the syllabus. Those are the most likely to be checked regularly.**

# How do I do well in this course?
**Most importantly:** complete the lecture and tutorial worksheets. These
are intended to help you learn the concepts so you'll do well on the project
and quizzes. The worksheets tend to be a bit easier and provide more guidance.
The tutorials are more difficult and give you a good sense for how well you've
learned the material. Students who make an effort to complete all of the
worksheets and tutorials tend to perform well in the class.

For lecture/tutorial worksheets, you can collaborate with your peers (this is
encouraged!) as discussing the material while you work on it will help you
learn. But you are not allowed to simply copy another student's work. That is
plagiarism, which is expressly forbidden in the course policy.

Time management is very important in this course. There are regular assessments
every week to keep you on track, but we move quickly and cover a lot of
ground. 

Take an active role in the learning community that we will build together. Ask
questions on Piazza when you have them, and try to answer each others'
questions when you can.
